# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Description and purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to practice the ETL process. We extracted and transformed data from a CVS to create a DataFrame. After that, we used our dataset to create an ERD and tebale schema for the load phase. We uplobaded the CSV that contained the bakcers' information into the database we created. We were able to transform a csv that had had all the data we needed in each individual row as strings. We created this into a dictionary and extracted the value for each key value pair to eventually create columns that held each value as a dataframe. We were then further able to clean this dataframe by splitting columns like first name and last name so the data was more digestable by the common eye.
